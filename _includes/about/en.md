> What is my expectation from any calculation of life?  

Hi，I am Yajin Mo, a PhD student joined [THU](1) right after COVID attack，currently working the lab of Prof. [Fan Zhou](2). An unbearably naive biology student with a theater-containing heart，forever-kind tyro in bioinformatics. Amateur conductor，Sax，once president of studnt union. Can never resist the lure of being alone, staying in the dark and my deep-in-heart one who accampany me at every single night.

##### Bioinformatics_2020Fall

Well, at least for now, I build this blog as a digital notebook as well as an idea pool for my bioinformatics lesson this term. Everything brought up by Prof. [Zhi Lu](3) in the first class grasped my attention and then my heart, and yeah here I am, ready for loads of learning materials and homework in the near future. (I am surely aware of how rough this blog is and will be, ~~then hope no one find out~~ but I will definetely make sure this will happen on rare occasion.)
